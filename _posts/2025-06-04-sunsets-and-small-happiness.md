So I understand that I'm late to the party, but it's never too late to acknowledge what is true. 

Recently at dinner with friends I was asked what makes me happy. 

"The small things," I said. Since coming to Jeju, I had made a weekend ritual out of chasing coastal sunsets while opening a new flavor of beer. 

"She's a sunset monster," my boyfriend added. 

His friend was excited: "There's a word for that in Korean! We call it *sohwakhaeng* (소확행). Small but certain happiness. It's like opening a can of beer after work." 

My boyfriend elaborated: "It's an abbreviation of the words 소소한 (trivial/minor) + 확실한 (certain) + 행복 (happiness)." 

Later I [looked it up] [1] and found out that the concept (*shōgakkō*) was first made by the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami in his 1986 essay "Afternoon in the Islets of Langerhans", where he described happiness as "eating a freshly baked loaf of bread or wearing a new shirt that smells like clean cotton".  

To be honest, I felt like it wasn't until coming to Jeju that I learned how to embody this. Prior to my arrival, my attempts at 소확행 seemed manufactured, something prompted by social media, a performance or acquired taste. But my weekend routine - calculating sunset times at different beaches, finding spots to sit and pop open a beer - was something spontaneous that came up from within me and then stayed. This routine was enough to recharge me for the rest of the week. 

Sometimes when the weather prevented me from going out, I looked to find other instances of 소확행. My favorite was going to my local stationery store or bookshop, where I could enjoy the smell of paper and flip through pages without urgency. I didn't need to buy anything - just being among quiet objects and soft textures was enough. 

*Small Mood: low sun, lovely farewells, paper-scented peace*
