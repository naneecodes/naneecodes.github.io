ðŸŒ± Welcome to **Small Mood Blog**: *A Soft Beginning*

I started this blog because I wanted a place where I could see and share what's currently on my mind, but without the urgency, pressure and glamour of social media. 

This blog was designed with a few choice criteria: 

1. **It doesn't hurt my eyes.** Here your eyes can rest on soft text with words meant to soothe and not stimulate. 

2. **There's no ads or clickbait.** I'm not starting this blog for monetization or advertising. This is a place for thoughts to simply exist. 

3. **It honors small moods.** Not everything needs to be a fully formed opinion or polished essay. This is a space where those moments can be held with care. 

This blog is meant to be a small corner of the internet to breathe, slow down, and to notice the brief but meaningful moments that make up the manuscript of our days.  

May this space feel like your favorite morning mug - a quiet place to sit with whatever mood you're carrying today.
