🌱 This is the very first post on *Small Mood Blog*.

It took me about 4 hours to make this blog, and that's because I mostly just spent time playing around with ChatGPT in an attempt to avoid doing homework for my last two weeks of Clinical Practice.

I also may have had a nervous breakdown since one of the few cons of living on a beautiful Korean island is that there's just not many people with whom I can discuss topics of interest to my heart's content. And my poor husband has to deal with me asking a million questions while watching any TV show. 

For the past five years I've been living in Jeju Island and soaking in all of nature's glorious healing energy, but I need a place for output and feedback. That's why I decided to start this blog, so I can just put everything I want to say and discuss in one place.
